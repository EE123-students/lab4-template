    "## Analog Modulation\n",
    "In analog communications we encode continuous valued signals on top of a carrier frequency. Information can be encoded in the amplitude, e.g. amplitude modulation (AM) or single sideband (SSB), encoded in the phase, e.g. phase modulation or frequency modulation or encoded in both phase and amplitude. One of the issues with analog modulation is that you can never get the signal you are transmitting exactly recovered. It will always be contaminated by system imperfections, noise and other deviations. \n",
    "At the same time, analog communication offers simple implementations as well as robustness because signals often degrade gracefully and information can still be extracted from them even with severe interferences and low signal to noise ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Digital Modulation\n",
    "In contrast, in digital communications we transmit quantized digital data. Because the information is digital, this form of communications offers the advantage of a perfect reproduction of the transmitted signal. Much like analog communications, digital data can be encoded in many different ways using phase, amplitude, and frequency. It can be encoded using a binary stream in which '0's and '1's are transmitted in each time interval. It can also be encoded with M-ary symbols, in which higher order _symbols_ are transmitted in each time interval. A 4-ary symbol can take 4 different values {0, 1, 2, 3}, so each symbol can represent 2 bits. In this case, the bit rate is twice the symbol rate.\n"

    "Instead of using rectangular pulses, we can use shaped pulses which have a more narrowband frequency response. This is called _pulse shaping_. For example, we could filter using a sinc-based pulse that would result in a bandlimited spectrum. This is refered to as a _pulse shaping filter_. Of course, it is not practical to use a sinc since it is infinite in length. Instead we can use truncated (windowed) sinc pulses with certain time-bandwidth (TBW) product that would be finite in length and narrowband. While we use windowed sinc functions here (as shown in class), the communications community often uses the *raised cosine filter* instead.

    "#### Phase-Shift Keying (PSK) \n",
    "PSK encodes digital data in the phase of the signal.  For example, Binary PSK (BPSK) sends a stream of '0's and '1's by alternating the sign of the carrier in each bit period: $Real \\left \\{ e^{j\\pi M(t)}\\cos(2\\pi f_0t) \\right \\}$, where $M(t)$ is a signal of $\\{0~or~1\\}$ corresponding to '0's and '1's. The RDS subcarrier in FM radio is BPSK encoded. Also, [PSK31](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSK31) is a very popular text-to-text ham radio protocol for HF that has 31 bit/s rate, which matches a typical keyboard typing rate. An M-ary symbol can be transmitted by MPSK in which $M(t)$ are broken to smaller intervals. For example, in 4-PSK (a.k.a. QPSK), the symbols {0, 1, 2, 4} are encoded in $M(t) = \\{0~or~0.5~or~1~or~1.5\\}$. They could also be encoded in a $45^\\circ$ rotated constellation using $M(t) = \\{0.25~or~0.75~or~1.25~or~1.75\\}$.\n",

    "#### Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK)\n",
    "FSK encodes digital data in the frequency of the carrier, i.e., $\\cos \\left(2\\pi (f_0 + M(t)\\Delta f)t\\right)$. For Binary FSK (BFSK),  $M(t) =\\{1~or~-1\\}$. In M-ary FSK (MFSK) the total bandwidth can be divided into more segments. Again, like PSK, FSK has a constant envelope which makes it ideal for use with efficient non-linear amplifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of frequencies has a huge impact on the signal's bandwidth and our ability to demodulate it. For example, we would like the frequencies to be orthogonal over a symbol period so that a correlation detector will produce the maximum difference between the results. We would also like the phase to be continuous for the sidelobes to decay rapidly and not interfere with nearby channels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the choice of frequencies of $\\{1200~\\text{Hz}, 2400~\\text{Hz}\\}$ below for a symbol rate of 300 baud results in 4 and 8 cycles per symbol period, respectively. The outcome is a smooth phase and orthogonal frequencies."

    "MSK is a very efficient modulation with constant envelope and a narrow bandwidth. However its sidelobes are still prohibitively high for applications like cellphone networks. The sidelobes can be further reduced by prefiltering the instantaneous frequency transitions by a smoothing filter. A very common filter is a Gaussian filter. When a Gaussian filter is used, the modulation is called GMSK. This is the modulation that is used for GSM networks. Much like the other modulations, filtering reduces the sidelobes, but increases the inter-symbol interference. \n",
